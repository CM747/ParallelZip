Run-length encoding can be expressed in multiple ways to accommodate data properties as well as additional compression algorithms.
For instance, one popular method encodes run lengths for runs of two or more characters only, 
using an "escape" symbol to identify runs, or using the character itself as the escape, so that any time a character appears twice it denotes a run.
